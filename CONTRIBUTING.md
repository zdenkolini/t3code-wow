# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This is an early, experimental release, so bug reports from real use are just as valuable as code.

The supported setup is **Omarchy 4.5.0**, **T3 Code Nightly** and **World of Warcraft: Forever** under Proton. macOS with the native client is also supported, with less testing. Changes that make other setups work are welcome, as long as they don't break those.

## Issues

Open an issue for a bug you can reproduce, or for a specific idea. Keep it detailed but straightforward: say what happened, plainly, and leave out the essay.

For a bug, include:

- **Versions**: Omarchy (`omarchy-version`) or macOS (`sw_vers`), T3 Code Nightly (`t3 --version`), t3code-wow (`t3code-wow status`), and your controller if it's involved.
- **What you did, what you expected, what happened instead.** Steps to reproduce if you have them.
- **`t3code-wow status --log`** output, and the text from `/t3 report` in game.
- **A screenshot or short video** for anything you can see: a layout problem, a wrong state, a notice that didn't appear. It's often the fastest way to explain the problem.

One problem per issue. If you're not sure it's a bug, say so and describe what you saw.

## Pull requests

- **One problem per PR.** Small, focused changes get reviewed and merged faster.
- **Say what changes and why**, in plain terms. Link the issue if there is one.
- **Say how you verified it**: the tests you ran and what you checked in game, with what you saw. Mention anything you couldn't check. "Tests pass" alone isn't enough.
- **Show UI changes.** Anything you can see in game needs before and after screenshots, and a short recording when motion, timing, controller navigation or interaction is part of the change. Drag them into the PR description so GitHub hosts them; never commit screenshots or recordings to the repo. If nothing visible changes, one line saying why is enough.
- **Commits** should be atomic, with short messages that describe the change.
- AI-assisted contributions are fine. You're responsible for having read, run and checked the result, the same as any other change.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow
cd t3code-wow
./install.sh                 # installs the addon and the bridge from your checkout
```

On Windows, run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1` instead of `./install.sh`, here and below.

After editing, run `./install.sh` from your checkout, then `/reload` in game. It copies your checkout over the installed copy, puts the addon into the game and restarts the bridge. (`t3code-wow sync` only re-copies the *installed* addon, so it won't pick up your edits.) New files inside the addon load on `/reload`; new addon folders (such as live-update slots) need a full game restart.

Tests:

```bash
cd bridge && npm test                                        # bridge, protocol, crypto, Lua/Node agreement
node tools/snapshot.mjs /tmp/t3snap.lua                      # a real snapshot from your running T3 Code
lua5.1 tools/smoke.lua addon/T3Code /tmp/t3snap.lua "$(cat /tmp/t3snap.view)"   # drive the addon headlessly
luajit tools/smoke.lua addon/T3Code /tmp/t3snap.lua "$(cat /tmp/t3snap.view)"   # same, with signed bit ops
```

On macOS, Homebrew doesn't package Lua 5.1: `brew install luajit` covers the LuaJIT runs, and the `lua5.1` ones need Lua 5.1 built from source.

`tools/wowstub.lua` stands in for the WoW API. Its widget methods come from the client's own API documentation, so calling a method that doesn't exist fails in tests the way it would in game.

Before changing how the addon and bridge talk, read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): several things that look like workarounds are deliberate, measured limits of the game client.

## Style

- Lua: tabs. JavaScript: two spaces, ES modules, no dependencies beyond Node itself.
- Text people see (in game, in the CLI, in docs) is plain and specific: say what happened and what to do, without jargon.

## Security

If you find a security problem, such as a way to send commands to someone's agents or read what they're sending, please report it privately through [GitHub's security advisories](https://github.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow/security/advisories/new) rather than a public issue.
