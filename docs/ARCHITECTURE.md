## Constraints this is built around

Measured on live Forever 1.60.1 clients (TOC 16001) by
[wow-forever-codex](https://github.com/0xinuarashi/wow-forever-codex) and
[wow-ai](https://github.com/chelinho139/wow-ai). The approach here builds on that work:

1. Addons can't use sockets or read files. They can draw pixels.
2. The client indexes addon files **at launch**. Files that exist then can be loaded
   later. `LoadAddOn` reads a load-on-demand addon's Lua from disk when it loads, and
   each addon loads once per UI session (`/reload` resets that). New files need a
   full restart.
3. `PlaySoundFile` returns whether a file will play. A file that has never loaded is
   read fresh every time. Once one plays, the result is cached until the process exits.
4. SavedVariables are only written on `/reload` or logout, and `ReloadUI()` needs a
   key press or click.

## Game → bridge: the strip

`Codec.lua` and `codec.js` share one frame format:

```
'T' '3' version  seq(2)  len(2)  payload…  fletcher16(2)
```

**Encryption.** The strip is on screen, so streams and recordings capture it. Version 2
frames (all of them, once the addon has its keys) carry

```
nonce(12)  ChaCha20(records)  HMAC-SHA-256(version, seq, nonce, ciphertext)[0..8]
```

- The bridge makes a random master key per install (`~/.local/state/t3code-wow/strip.key`,
  mode 0600) and derives an encryption key and a MAC key from it. Both go into every
  snapshot it writes to the slots. Slot files are never on screen.
- The addon keeps the keys in file-local variables in `Transport.lua`. They aren't on
  the exported `T3Code` table and aren't saved. The slot global is cleared on load.
- Nonces are a per-load prefix (time and random bytes) plus a counter, and a frame is
  re-sealed only when its content changes.
- Version 1 (plaintext) frames are only ever a bare hello with no thread id. The addon
  sends one before it has keys, and the bridge answers it with a snapshot carrying
  them. The bridge never runs commands from a plaintext frame and drops any encrypted
  frame that fails the tag.
- Replays are harmless: the bridge only runs command ids above the last one it ran
  for that session.
- `Crypto.lua` implements ChaCha20 and SHA-256 on the client's `bit` library; the bridge
  uses Node's. `bridge/test/crypto.test.js` checks they agree under both signed (LuaJIT)
  and unsigned (WoW-style) `bit` results, and that a strip the addon draws decrypts only
  with the right keys. Cost in game: about 0.2 ms per frame, a few ms for a full
  2,000-character message.

This keeps out viewers and anything else that can draw on the screen. It can't stop
another addon in the same game: addons share one Lua state, so a malicious addon could
drive T3 Code's UI directly. Only install addons you trust.

The frame is packed into 3-bit cells. Each cell is a 3×3-pixel square with R, G and B
each fully on or off. The strip is 160 cells per row and up to 40 rows (about 2.4 KB),
scaled so one UI unit is one physical pixel. It is anchored at the top-left of
`UIParent` on the TOOLTIP strata. The bridge searches cell sizes 2–8 and small offsets,
so a border or scaling quirk doesn't break it.

The payload is records separated by `RS` (0x1E), with fields separated by `US` (0x1F):

```
H  1  session  ui  nextSlot  sigNext  gen  flags  viewThreadId  addonVersion
C  id  verb  args…                      (one per queued command)
```

- `session` is persistent (SavedVariables). `ui` is new every load, so the bridge can
  tell a `/reload` happened.
- `flags`:
  - `o`: window open
  - `t`: tracker on
  - `g`: gamepad UI
  - `r`: read finished replies with the desktop voice
  - `s`: sound signals unavailable
- Verbs:
  - `send`, `new`, `stop`
  - `settle`, `unsettle`, `archive`, `read`
  - `approve`, `answer`
  - `speak`, `say`, `hush`, `dictate`
  - `ping`

The strip is drawn only while something is unacknowledged. "Something" means a status
change such as opening the window or switching threads, or a queued command. It is
redrawn when content changes and hidden as soon as a snapshot acknowledges its
sequence number, usually in under a second. If nothing answers for 20 s, it hides and
retries with backoff.

**macOS.** The bridge finds the game window in CoreGraphics' window list (through a JXA script run by `osascript`, so there's nothing to compile) and captures the corner with `screencapture -R`, which returns physical pixels on a Retina display. The strip can start below the window's top: under a windowed game's title bar, or below the notch of a MacBook display in fullscreen. So the decoder searches 40 extra points down instead of guessing either height. Both tools run as the bridge, which needs the Screen Recording permission; the bridge asks for it when it starts.

**Windows.** The bridge starts one hidden PowerShell process for its lifetime, which compiles a small C# class with `Add-Type` (the compiler ships with Windows' .NET Framework, so there's nothing to install) and answers requests over stdin and stdout. Starting it per frame would cost about half a second each time. Its thread is per-monitor DPI aware, so window positions and captures are in physical pixels on every monitor and at any display scaling. The bridge lists the top-level windows of the game's process (or with the game's window class, `waApplication Window`), picks the game window, and copies the top-left corner of its client area, which starts below a windowed game's title bar, with GDI from the screen. Like `screencapture`, this reads what is on screen: a minimized or cloaked window (on another virtual desktop) is reported as hidden, and a window covering the corner hides the strip. Exclusive fullscreen gives GDI a black screen, so a black capture of a window that covers its monitor is reported as a request to switch to Windowed (Fullscreen).

## Bridge → game: slots and signals

`T3Code_S001…S1200` (1,200 by default) are load-on-demand addons grouped under T3Code in
the addon list (`## Group`). They deliberately have no `## Dependencies`: WowUp hides
an unrecognised load-on-demand folder only when all its dependencies are recognised, and
T3Code isn't on CurseForge, so a dependency on it made every slot its own "Unknown" row
(1,200 rows, measured with WowUp 2.24). Without it WowUp shows one "T3 Code" entry.

Addon managers also fingerprint each folder (a 32-bit hash of the `.toc` and the files it
lists) and look it up across all of CurseForge. A slot that listed `Inbox.lua` directly
produced a fresh hash with every update, and one collided: WowUp took a slot for a
Minecraft modpack, which an "update" would have installed over it. So every slot's TOC is
identical and lists a static `Slot.xml`, which loads `Inbox.lua` with
`<Script file="Inbox.lua"></Script>`. The scanners only follow self-closing `<Script/>`
tags, so all slots share one fixed fingerprint that matches nothing on CurseForge
(checked with WowUp's own hashing code and a rescan).
Each contains `Inbox.lua`, which assigns `T3Code_Inbox = { … }`. The bridge serializes
plain data with `luaser.js`, so thread text can never become code. All text is escaped
for WoW markup (`|` → `||`), then markdown is turned into colors and bullets.

A publish works like this:

1. Build the snapshot: threads, projects, the viewed thread's messages, pending
   question or approval, usage, bridge status, command results and the ack.
2. Write it to the slots the addon will load next (from its last confirmed position
   to a little past the bridge's prediction) and to slots 1–3 (what a `/reload`
   bootstraps from).
3. Ring the next **bell**.

**Bells (the "new update" signal).** Measured on this client:

- `PlaySoundFile` returns `willPlay = true` for *every* file, even empty or garbage
  ones, so its answer is useless.
- `C_Sound.IsPlaying(handle)` a fraction of a second later is reliable: real sounds
  play and empty files don't.
- Sound files bigger than `Sound_MaxCacheableSizeInBytes` (174,762 bytes here) are
  streamed and re-opened from disk on every play (confirmed by watching file
  access), so they're never stuck in the cache.

So a bell is a 10-second silent WAV (441 KB), and those ten files are all of `Signals/`. The bridge rings bell `k` by writing
that sound and empties bell `k-4`. The addon plays bells `sigNext … sigNext+3` every
0.5 s, checks which is really playing 0.15 s later, stops them all, and loads one slot
if one rang. Eight bells rotate forever, with no per-session limit. They live at
`Signals/03991–03998.wav`; `03999` (always long) and `04000` (always empty) are the
self-test controls. These names already existed when the client started, which
matters because the client only knows files that existed at launch.

If game sound is entirely off, the self-test fails and the addon falls back to
loading a slot on a timer (3 s while you're using the window, 20 s open, 90 s closed).

Measured in game: a 1.2 s round trip from strip to update, 1 slot per 2 idle minutes
with the window closed, and 2 per minute with it open.

**Pacing.** Each publish costs one slot, so the bridge paces by what you're doing:

| Situation | Interval |
| --- | --- |
| Acks and command results | ~0.5 s |
| Viewing a working thread | 2 s |
| Window open | 1.5–3 s |
| Window closed, status changes | 3 s |
| Window closed, minor changes | 20 s |
| Heartbeat (window open / closed) | 90 s / 240 s |

When few slots remain, intervals stretch 2–4×. When they run out, the addon offers
`/reload`.

## T3 Code side

`t3.js` uses the same API as T3's own clients:

- **Auth:** a session token from `t3 auth session issue --scope orchestration:read
  --scope orchestration:operate`, renewed a week before it expires.
- **Live data:** `POST /api/auth/websocket-ticket/rpc` gets a ticket, then
  `/ws?orchestrationProtocol=2` opens Effect RPC JSON frames.
- **Subscriptions:** `orchestration.subscribeShell` (thread list, live) and
  `subscribeServerConfig` (providers and usage limits).
- **Thread detail:** `GET /api/orchestration/threads/:id/bounded`, fetched for the
  viewed thread and for active threads so the tracker can say what they're doing.
- **Writes:** `orchestration.dispatchCommand` with `message.dispatch`, `run.interrupt`,
  `runtime-request.respond`, `thread.settle`, `thread.unsettle` and `thread.visit`;
  plus `orchestration.launchThread`.

## Controller

While the window is open it takes the gamepad itself (`EnableGamePadButton` /
`EnableGamePadStick`), so the character doesn't move and B closes the window. The D-pad
moves between controls by position, with explicit routes where position isn't enough
(thread list → message box, for example). Blizzard's `SmartNavigationPointerTemplate`
draws the cursor.

The addon never touches the binding-group APIs, which would taint the gamepad action
bars, and avoids Blizzard's `Menu` (it caused "blocked action" errors). LB/RB switch
tabs, X reads aloud, Y dictates, and the right stick scrolls the transcript. Forever has
no on-screen keyboard, so text input uses dictation, quick replies and option buttons.
The game menu gets a T3 Code button, and a controller chord opens the window.
